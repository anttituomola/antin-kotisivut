Signs of a good gym:
- resembles a professional woodworking shop: everything has its own marked place, and everything is either currently in use or in its designated spot
- locker rooms don't stink
- locker rooms have proper privacy — no line of sight from other areas when the door opens
- in locker rooms, people's belongings are in lockers and only there, not lying around in common areas
- toilets and showers are clean
- men's restroom doors must have automatic door closers, because men won't bother closing them and will subject everyone in the locker room to their urination vaguely aimed at the urinal
- staff should practice what they preach: eat right, train hard, and work out regularly at their own gym
- staff should have strong, well-reasoned opinions about what makes a good gym
- staff should be open and genuinely interested in others' opinions about what makes a good gym
- members should represent a wide range of ages and genders, and everyone should feel welcome
- facilities should include a self-service vending machine for water bottles, energy bars, and the like
- equipment must be high quality: sturdy hooks, heavy-duty cables, and barbell racks that don't rattle
- there must be enough essential lifting stations — squat racks, deadlift platforms — so queues don't form
- when the gym is being renovated and developed, changes should primarily benefit the members, not the business — the business may certainly benefit from them, but they cannot be primarily made for the business's sake

Come to think of it, most of these principles would make any space, community, or organization better.

This text was inspired by my own gym. It's a decent gym, and very close to my home. But Jesus, it could be so, so much better, and it would only take a little effort and genuine interest.
