TypeScript has become the standard for large-scale JavaScript applications. Let's explore the best practices that will help you write better TypeScript code.

## Type Safety

TypeScript's main strength is its type system. Here are some tips for leveraging it effectively:

1. Use strict mode
2. Leverage interface inheritance
3. Implement proper error handling

## Advanced Patterns

```typescript
type Result<T, E = Error> = {
  success: true;
  data: T;
} | {
  success: false;
  error: E;
};
```
